# Judicial Favoritism of Politicians

This repository contains programs and analysis scripts used for drafting my second dissertation paper, "Judicial Favoritism of Politicans: Evidence from Small Claims Courts" (co-authored with [Julio Trecenti](https://github.com/jtrecenti)). 

I don't make all data available yet as this project has been submitted for research funding and data management is subject to funding approval. I am, however, happy to address data or research questions you might have. Please email andre.assumpcao@gmail.com for questions.
